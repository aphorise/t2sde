[I] Utilities to directly access DOS disks in Unix

[T] This directory contains mtools. Mtools is a collection of utilities to
[T] access MS-DOS disks from GNU and Unix without mounting them. It supports
[T] Win'95 style long file names, OS/2 Xdf disks and 2m disks (store up to
[T] 1992k on a high density 3 1/2 disk). In addition to file access, it
[T] supports many FAT-specific features: volume labels, FAT-specific file
[T] attributes (hidden, system, ...), "bad block" map maintenance, access to
[T] remote floppy drives, Iomega ZIP disk protection, "secure" erase, display
[T] of file's on-disk layout, etc.
