[I] Lightning Memory-Mapped Database

[T] Symas LMDB is an extraordinarily fast, memory-efficient database we
[T] developed for the OpenLDAP Project. With memory-mapped files, LMDB has
[T] the read performance of a pure in-memory database while retaining the
[T] persistence of standard disk-based databases.
